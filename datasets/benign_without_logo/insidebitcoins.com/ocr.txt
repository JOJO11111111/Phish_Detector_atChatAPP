Forex signals can help you make the right investment choice and it can really assist you in making critical decisions. Being a trader can sometimes be daunting as you are making many independent decisions — this is where signals are very useful as itis a ‘second opinion to help you make the correct profitable move. This can really help with risk management as you are not alone in  making your trades.  An important part of trading is also monitoring the market, watching the price movement and analysing the trend. However, it is impossible for a trader to monitor the markets 24 hours a day without sleep and so Forex signals can do a lot of this hard work for you  (especially automated signals) , keeping an eye on currency pairs all day every day.

Asignal will usually begin by discussing the currency pair, when to open a new trade and what risk level/position size should be used for the particular trade. Some signals also identify key support and resistance zones. It is crucial to check the timing of the signal because important price action can happen in between the signal being delivered and you actually reading the signal. There can be  short-term signals for day trading and long-term signals (these can last daysiweeks) and this can impact the way you use the signal.  if the signal is advising you to open a long or short position, an effective way of using a signal is waiting for a solid candle close (at least a thr candle) above the resistance zone (for a long) or below the support zone (for a short). A solid candle close can better indicate a change or continuation of a trend, meaning it can sometimes be worth sacrificing a better entry position (indicated by the signal) in order to wait for the candlestick close to confirm the trend direction. This method limits risk greatly and can be a lucrative strategy if  used properly and patiently.     Let's take the above chart as an example. You receive a signal that indicates there is strong resistance at 1.07 and it is a good ‘opportunity to short. Now, while it may seem tempting to place a short/sell order at that level — it is important to see where the next  candle closes. This may sacrifice a better entry point, however, it may save you entering a losing trade altogether. As you can see on the chart, the next candle blasts right through resistance which would have made a terrible start to the trade. Patience can really limit  risk when trading, so when using other trader's signals it is very important to stay cautious and keep patient to keep risk at a minimum.     This example is similar to the previous chart, however, the price rejects off the strong resistance. Let's say the signal indicates that, there is resistance at 1.03 and it is worth opening a short/sell trade. If the trader waits for the red candle close after touching resistance, they get a slightly lower entry point but the risk is much less. As the price action continues, the short signal turns into a very  profitable trade, limiting risk by not rushing into a trade.  What Types of Forex Signals Exist?  Automated Forex Trading Signals  ‘An automated signal will generally be a piece of software that has been created by an experienced trader in order to analyse the market using mostly technical indicators. The system usually can send out signals independently and it will monitor a plethora of markets 24 hours a day, 7 days week — meaning it can process a huge amount of information. Automated signals have the advantage  of being able to identify signals extremely quickly and they will not have an emotional bias.  Human Forex Trading Signals This will usually consist of a single or group of traders analysing the markets and news to send out signals.
