					<p>Some of the materials presented in the Website may allow Clients to perform calculations and carry out analysis on the basis of hypothetical results, figures and indices. Hypothetical performance results have many inherent limitations. There are frequently sharp differences between hypothetical performance results and actual results subsequently achieved by any particular trading program. Client should recognise that hypothetical trading does not involve financial risk, and no hypothetical trading record can completely account of the impact of financial risk in actual trading, for example, the ability to withstand losses or to adhere to a particular trading program in spite of losses are material points which also can adversely affect actual trading results. There are numerous other factors related to the markets in general or to the implementation of any specific trading program which cannot be fully accounted for in the preparation of hypothetical performance results and all of which can adversely affect actual trading results.</p>
